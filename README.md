## Why Sora-Style Prompts Matter
Sora-style video generation has unique rhythm, motion patterns and
scene-transition logic. These optimized prompts help creators achieve 
higher-quality shots with any Sora-compatible or Sora-style model.

## Multi-Model Notes
We also study how Sora-style prompts behave across different models
(Gemini-V, Veo, Runway, Luma, etc.) and track their differences in motion stability.
